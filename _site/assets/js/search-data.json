The reaction volume is 200 µl which is good for 4 different libraries if either 96 well plates are used or silicon gaskets. The first time you try the protocol we suggest doing so in well-adhered cell culture and starting small with only 2-4 libraries. The first time you try it we also suggest using a minimal version of the protocol that doesnt include gDNA digestion or overnight primer hybridization just to see that you get in situ amplicons in your hands. Most of those amplicons will be rRNA but by first verifying that you can get nice and round in situ amplicons it is then easier to ad the gDNA digestion step as well as steps necessary to decrease rRNA reads. Steps not necessary to get in situ amplicons are marked with the label Optional .

    "content": ". Fixation 10-20 min . Note: INSTA-seq is compatible with both formalin fixation and methanol or ethanol fixation. However crosslinking signatures are not guaranteed with ethanol fixation. | Ethanol: ad ice cold 100% ethanol onto the cells/tissue and incubate in -20 degree overnight. For sensitive tissues/cells do a gradual incubation 50%,80%, 100% ethanol and rehydration 80%, 50%, DEPC-1xPBS. | Formalin fixation: incubate in 5-15 min in formalin. Incubation time needs to be optimized depending on if you have fluorescent proteins present and want to be able to visualize them before in situ sequencing. If fluorescent proteins are present incubate for 15 min otherwise keep the formalin fixation to 5-10 min. | . Tissue permeabilization . Membrane permeabilization: 0:20-1 h . If you do ethanol fixation this is not needed. Cell culture: 20 min incubation in room temperature with DEPC-1xPBS with 0.3% triton-X100. Drosophila tissue: 1 hr incubation in room temperature with: . 1 | Amount | Reagent | Final concentration | . | 195 µl | DEPC-1xPBS with 0.3% triton-X100 |   | . | 5 µl | SUPERase | 0.5 U/µl | . This step needs tissue-specific optimization. If uncertain start with 20 min incubation and then extend to 1 hr. If that is still not good enough you might need to use additional proteinase K digestion. Nuclear permeabilization: 10-45 min . Although DNase I can enter the nucleus for it to be able to digest gDNA reliably you might need additional unmasking using HCl treatment. This step might require optimization for specific cell line or tissue in itself. Do so by extending either the HCl incubation time or the DNase I incubation time and use DAPI staining as readout of DNase I gDNA removal without any library prep. Common issue is little DAPI signal decrease due to inability of DNase I to fully digest all gDNA in the nucleus, again proteinase treatment might aid in specifically difficult cells. Cell culture: 10 min incubation in room temperature with DEPC-PBS with 0.1N HCl. Drosophila tissue: 45 min incubation in room temperature with with DEPC-PBS with 0.1N HCl.

Incubate for 1hr at 37°C. Inactivation of DNase I and extensive wash. There are two ways to inactivate DNase I. Either use the the inactivation reagent provided in the kit or use ice cold 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0. The inactivation reagent in the kit will also remove divalent cations, such as magnesium and calcium. The inactivation reagent is very viscous and needs to be thawed completely and vortexed several times. Aspirate and wash 3 times in ice cold nuclease free water and ad the inactivation reagent. 2 | Amount | Reagent | Final concentration | . | 180 µl | Nuclease free water |   | . | 20 µl | DNase Inactivation Reagent |   | . Incubate at room temperature for 30 min while on a shaker. The inactivation reagent will form miscelles that you can see under a normal dissection microscope. They easily sink to the bottom of the plate and will form a white precipitate you can see by eye. You need to thouroughly wash the sample with ice cold nuclease free water multiple times until the white precipitate is completely removed. First time you do it wash several times and check under microscope to make sure you completely removed it. Alternatively instead of the inactivation reagent use EDTA that sequester divalent cations that may be cofactors for DNase. Wash threee times with 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0, and leave to incubate in 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0 for 30 min and wash several times afterward with ice cold nuclease free water. Primer hybridization O/N .

Use the 200 μl and pipette mix ten times and aspirate the sample and ad the ice cold enzyme mix onto the sample and let it sit on ice for 5 min. Place the sample for reverse transcription at 37°C for 2h - Over night. Make sure to seal the sample with parafilm and include a damp kimtech wipe so the sample doesnt dry out. If the sample would dry out during RT there is no point in continuing and you can throw away the sample. Drying out during other overnight incubations such as the phi29 RCA amplification is not . cDNA fixation 1h . In all of the above reactions aa-dUTP is included for subsequent crosslinking of the cDNA to free primary amines using NHS-PEG9-NHS (BSPEG9). This was based on initial concerns with FISSEQ that cDNA was difusing. However, in our experience diffusion is not a big problem as much as fixation can inhibit subsequent enzymatic steps. For example at the average cDNA length of 100-80 nt and an incorporation rate of ~30/kb for aa-dUTP would mean about three aminoallyl groups are incorporated for each cDNA molecule. aa-dUTP incorporation into cDNA and subsequent fixation after RT can therefore be ommited.

Immediatly ad the reaction to the sample after aspirating the RT reaction (NHS ester half-life 1 hour at pH 8 and only 10 minutes at pH 8.6). NHS ester-activated crosslinkers react with primary amines best in slightly alkaline conditions it is therefore important to use pH 8 1xPBS when dissolving the DMSO stock for the reaction. Incubate the sample at room temperature for 1h. Quenching 30 min . To avoid BSPEG9 to react with enzyme in subsequent steps quench the reaction by aspirating and ad 1 M Tris to the sample and incubate at room temperature for 30 min. RNA removal 1h . This step only applies if you intend to use CircLigase II since the enzyme is an RNA ligase removing RNA from the cell is necessary otherwise very few cDNAs will be circularized. | Amount | Reagent | Vendor | Concentration | . | 165 µl | Nuclease-free water | 10977015, Invitrogen | NA | . | 20 µl | 10x RNase H1 buffer | Y9220L, Qiagen | 1x | . | 5 µl | RNase, DNase-free 0.5 μg/ul | 11119915001, Roche | 12.5 ng/µl | . | 10 µl | RNase H1 (5 U/µl) | Y9220L, Qiagen | 0.25 U/µl | . Incubate at 37°C for 1h. Wash extensively three times in ice cold nuclease-free water. CircLigase II circularization 2h . If you used a RT primer with 5’PO4 group then you can circularize the cDNA enzymatically using CircLigase II. Make sure you have removed any remaining RNA in the tissue during the previous step since RNA will inhibit CircLigase II from circularization of cDNA. Prepare the CircLigase II buffer on ice and preincubate the sample: . | Amount | Reagent | Vendor | Concentration | . | 130 µl | Nuclease-free water | 10977015, Invitrogen | NA | . | 20 µl | 10x CircLigase buffer | Lucigen | 1x | . | 10 µl | 50 mM MnCl2 | Lucigen | 2.5 mM | . | 13 µl | 5 M Betaine | Lucigen | 0.5 mM | .

Incubate at 60°C for 2h. RCA primer hybridization 1.5h . If you included RCA primer in the click reaction then you dont have to do this unless you noticed that rolonies are fuzzy and not as compact then optimization of the RCA primer hybdirization condition could be needed. 1 30% formamide, 2xSSC, RCA primer hybridization . | 138 µl | 2xSSC (pre-dilute 20xSSC) | AM9770, Invitrogen | NA | . | 60 µl | Formamide | 75-12-7, Acros | 10% | . | 2 µl | RCA primer | 100 µM AAAAAATCAGCGTTCCCG IDT | 1 µM | .

It is important to make sure you have removed the formamide since residues at the edges of the well will inhibit RCA. If formamide inhibited RCA then you will still see some amplicons but they will be small and not bright. Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) O/N . Make sure formamide is not remaining in the well, especially at the edges. Place the sample on ice and make first a buffer only reaction mix: . | Amount | Reagent | Vendor | Concentration | . | 180 µl | Nuclease-free water | 10977015, Invitrogen | NA | . | 20 µl | 10x phi29 buffer | Qiagen | 1x | .

Terminology . In situ amplicon: a diffraction limited spot created here by rolling circle amplification (RCA) hence it is a rolling circle product (RCP). In situ sequencing adapter (ISSA): the 5’overhang adapter of the reverse transcription primer later on becomes the target for the sequencing primer. Sequencing primer: an oligonucleotide capable of being extended on both ends usually targeting a region in the ISSA. At each hybridization round a new sequencing primer is hybridized after the previous one is removed. The new sequencing primer is usually a recessed version of the previous one. The primer rounds can continue to recess until the limit of stringent hybdirization is reached which is usually around 12 nt length. Round: a hybridization round is started anytime the ssDNA RCP is stripped and a new sequencing primer is hybridized against the adapter region of the RCP. Cycle: a ligation cycle is anytime the sequencing primer is extended by chemical ligation. Stripping: the process of removing the entire sequencing primer from the ssDNA amplicon . Base call: the act and algorithm of assigning a determined nucleotide base to a single amplicon based on the fluorescent signal read out. In situ sequencing run: the complete set of base calls made during N rounds and M ligation cycles. Forward reads: reads extending the sequencing primer in the 5’-3’ direction of the sequencing template. For cDNA sequencing of in situ amplicons this means sequencing at the cDNA synthesis stop site. Reverse reads: reads extending the sequencing primer in the 3’-5’ direction of the sequencing template. For cDNA sequencing of in situ amplicons this means sequencing at the reverse transcription primer annealing site. ",

This can be true for less sensitive assays but when you really want to remove an extended sequencing primer that can be over 50 nt in length the purity of the formamide will matter. A standard trick is to put the formamide bottle in -20 and then aspirate the supernatant that doesnt freeze and throw away (ionized formamide). While this can work sometimes we rather figured out that the best performance in terms of reliability is to use aliquots of highly deionized formamide (Hi-Di Formamide) that are usually on capillary electrophoresis systems for Sanger sequencing.

    "content": "Visual inspection of cDNA libraries. When inspecting newly made libraries there are some quality markers you want to check that will tell you how clean the in situ sequencing will be. First, brightness of the amplicon is an important parameter. Ligation to a sequencing primer will not be as bright as direct fluorescent hybridization and at every subsequent ligation cycle the signal diminishes. Brightness. Think about it as a finite resource where the brightness of the amplicon is reduced at every cycle and eventually you will hit the autofluorescent noise floor. With really bright amplicons you will get more ligation cycles. This is infact one of the primary motivations behind the interrogation scheme of PRICKLi since it is very well known that there is a particular drop in signal to noise after ligation cycle 4, standard PRICKli sequencing using 11 bases makes sure that all of those cycles are of high quality putting less pressure on having a crisp and clean sample. Having said that it is also important to understand that when the tempate is stripped from the sequencing primer it is like erasing all previous history and restarting again. Therefore the ligation cycle 1 on each primer round is usually the best signal to noise ratio. Shape. Apart from brightness in situ amplicon shape is an important observation that will tell you how good the amplicons were crosslinked. Amino-allyl-dUTPs are incorporated into the amplicon and crosslinked using BSPEG9. The use of aa-dUTP alone makes the amplicon much more compact than what other more traditional in situ sequencing assay would do just using dNTP (see Kim et al. 2018 for a really nice outline on the role of aa-dUTP) but a lot of the shape will also be determined by crosslinking. Amine-reactive crosslinkers have the added benefit that they can be irreversibly crosslinked and therefore heat-resistant unlike PFA that would not tolerate the repeated elevated temperatures of primer stripping. The bad thing with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester reactive groups is that they will easily hydrolyse in water so from the time BSPEG9 is dissolved into DMSO unless store desiccated at -20°C it will go bad within 2-3 weeks. You will know that it has gone bad by the shape of the amplicons that will start looking fuzzy and not round and nice. If the amplicon would not be crosslinked properly they will start falling apart when stored in room temperature and they are much more easily damaged by lasers during imaging. So starting with round, bright and small amplicons is preferable, since it will make your life much easier down the line. Fluorescent adapter stripping and sequencing primer hybridization. To strip away the fluorescent adapter take out an aliquot of the 80% (vol/vol) 0.01% triton stripping buffer and heat it at 80°C on a heatblock for atleast 5 mins. The first time you perform stripping it is usually a good exercise to turn on the microscope and image the amplicons in live mode while you ad the hot stripping buffer onto the sample. You will directly see how all the fluorescent signal disappears within a second. To make sure that the primer is properly removed adhere to the following stripping protocol: . Incubate the sample four times 5 min each in 200 ul of stripping buffer, preheated to 80 °C. Between each strip wash the sample two times under running 10 ml 2xSSC dispensed through automatic fluidics or a simple 10 ml pipettor while simultaneously aspirating the sample. PRICKLi probe handling . When handling fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides it is important to let them thaw completely and then heat them up for 2 min at 80°C and let them cool down to room temperature. The heating reduces issues of fluorophores forming precipitates or clumps that later will appear as 3-5 µm bright fluorescent clumps in the tissue and are very hard to wash away. Further more, to avoid repeated freeze thaw cycles calculate how much of the probes you need and then prepare single aliquots in PCR tubes and store in 4 degree or room temperature protected from light while you are performing the sequencing run. 100 µM stocks of the PRICKLi probes should be stored in -80°C and then take out the full amount you need and mix together the three probes for each direction (forward and reverse) into equimolar concentrations. If you are to perform 11 base sequencing (6 image cycles) then first prepare these two run stocks: . Forward PRICKli probes for 6 cycles . | Amount | Reagent | Final concentration | . | 11 µl | 100 µM FR (A/G) FITC fwd | 33.3 µM | . | 11 µl | 100 µM FR (T/G) TxRd fwd | 33.3 µM | . | 11 µl | 100 µM FR (C) NA fwd | 33.3 µM | . Reverse PRICKli probes for 6 cycles . | Amount | Reagent | Final concentration | . | 11 µl | 100 µM RR (A/G) Cy5 rev | 33.3 µM | . | 11 µl | 100 µM RR (T/G) Cy3 rev | 33.3 µM | . | 11 µl | 100 µM RR (C) NA rev | 33.3 µM | . Then dispense the two probes with 5 µl each into 6 different PCR tubes (one for each cycle). In the end you should have 6 x 2 (cycle x direction) PCR tubes with 5 µl in each. Also aliquot for single use the T4 DNA ligase buffer to avoid repeated freeze thaw cycles (ATP in buffer), 20 µl each in 12 PCR tubes and store in -20°C. Forward ligation. A single 200 µl ligation reaction would be composed of this. | Amount | Reagent | Final concentration | . | 165 µl | Nuclease-free water | NA | . | 20 µl | 10× T4 DNA ligase buffer | 1× | . | 10 µl | T4 DNA ligase, 120 U/μl | 6 U/μl | . | 5 µl | 100 µM Forward PRICKLi probes | 2.5 μM | . Pipette up and down to make sure the probes are mixed then aspirate the sample and ad the ligation mix to the sample and incubate for 45 min at room temperature. After 45 min wash with 10 ml of 2xSSC three times for 5 min each. Reverse ligation. A single 200 µl ligation reaction would be composed of this. | Amount | Reagent | Final concentration | . | 165 µl | Nuclease-free water | NA | . | 20 µl | 10× T4 DNA ligase buffer | 1× | . | 10 µl | T4 DNA ligase, 120 U/μl | 6 U/μl | . | 5 µl | 100 µM Reverse PRICKLi probes | 2.5 μM | . Pipette up and down to make sure the probes are mixed then aspirate the sample and ad the ligation mix to the sample and incubate for 45 min at room temperature. After 45 min wash with 10 ml of 2xSSC three times for 5 min each. Image. For successful imaging there are essentially two things that has to be considered. 1) You need to equilize the histograms of the fluorescent channels so that they are matched by combining laser power and exposure time. 2) You want all amplicons represented and have a large dynamic range of the histogram but not so you saturate too many pixels. These tasks can be done automatically by use of histogram equilibration algorithm (see one that we use for post-acquisition image processing). But if you are not allow to program the microscope either becaus eof shared resource or vendor restrictions then this can ofcourse be done manually. To do this manually it is essential to switch histogram view of the image to log-scale. Adjust exposure time first so that all the histogram between the four channels look similar. In later cycles adjusting exposure time alone might not be enough since the exposure time might be too long then increase laser power. As a rule of thumb always try to adjust exposure time before increasing laser power since repeated laser damage to in situ amplicons will destroy them. Because imaging needs to be adjusted at each cycle we advice that a seperate tissue or part of the tissue or cells in the same well as the sample of interest are used to calibrate the imaging parameters rather then expsoing the intended sample to unnecessary light exposure. Cleave. NEB4 buffer is a critical buffer to be able to cleave. It can preferable be used to wash before imaging and be the buffer the imaging is performed in. RNase H2 can have reduced ability to cleave if Mg2+ are sequestred and its activity can be improved by including 0.1% Triton X-100 into NEB4 buffer. As an excersise we highly recommend the user to first cleave forward using Endo V followed by RNase H2 cleaving to see that the two systems work independently and then try to cleave with both enzymes in NEB4 buffer to see that simultaneous cleaving works even better. Make sure to preincubate the sample in NEB4 buffer before starting the cleaving reaction. | Amount | Reagent | Final concentration | . | 165 µl | Nuclease-free water | NA | . | 20 µl | 10× T4 DNA ligase buffer | 1× | . | 10 µl | T4 DNA ligase, 120 U/μl | 6 U/μl | . | 5 µl | 100 µM Reverse PRICKLi probes | 2.5 μM | .

    "title": "Pitfalls of in situ sequencing.",
    "content": "Any sequencing method that makes use of the inherent 3'OH/5'PO4 functional moeities will have issues when applied to in situ sequencing simply because remaining fixed nucleic acids (e.g. gDNA) can serve as substrate. For both SBS and SBL this issue is usually seen as high nuclear autofluorescence due to polymerase either extending free 3’OH on nicked and hydrolysed gDNA (like a TUNEL assay) or in the case of SBL displaced 5’ends with free 5'PO4 groups serve as splinted ligation targets. If one is working with heavily damaged hydrolysed samples then working with PRICKLi one will eventually see the following: . | Ligation on forward end fails with bright nuclear signal. | Ligation of reverse end works. | . What happened here? . The explanation is fairly straightforward and simple. The polymerase used to amplify the circular cDNA into amplicons, phi29 DNA polymerase, will also act on any remaining gDNA and because phi29 has such good strand displacement it will displace strands of gDNA. The displaced strands will have directionality so they will be displaced primarly at the 5’end where they also will have free 5’phos group for T4 DNA ligase to act on. What can then happen is that the free 5’phos end will be splinted by two probes and T4 DNA ligase will irreversibly ligate the fluorescent probe onto the gDNA with no base specificity and because Endo V needs double-stranded substrate it will be impossible to cleave away the probe. This will mainly happen at the forward end reads and not the reverse end. In highly hydrolysed samples one will also see it on the reverse end. It is important to distinguish this nuclear background from that of a failed ligation. In a failed ligation T4 DNA ligase will not ligate, most likely because of old T4 DNA ligase buffer (ATP freeze thaw sensitivity), this can happen when buffer is more than a year old in such cases you would see the probes getting soaked up in the nucleus but this more resembles traditional weak autofluorescence where in the case of splinted gDNA ligation on hydrolyzed gDNA the signal would be amazingly much brighter than anything else in the sample. phi29 Displaced strand 5’PO4 T4 DNA ligase Splinted ligation Non-cleavable nuclear background To avoid this issue when working with samples that have undergone hydrolysis (especially if gDNA digestion is not complete or hydrolysis was primarily done before RCA) simply treat the sample with a combination of CIP and TdT together with acyclovir in Quick CIP buffer. CIP will remove 5’ phosphate groups and TdT will tail free 3’OH ends with a single acyclonucleotide. One hour incubation is usually more than sufficient. | Reagent | Vendor | Amount | Concentration | . | 171 µl | Nuclease-free water | 10977015, Invitrogen | NA | . | 20 µl | 10x Quick CIP buffer | NEB | 1x | . | 5 µl | Quick CIP | NEB | 250 μM | . | 2 µl | TdT | NEB | 40 μM | . | 2 µl | Acyclovir | NEB | 40 μM | . In particularly bad samples this small trick can be applied just after stripping to ensure that any newly hydrolysed or displaced parts do not get labeled. This is especially true if the in situ amplicon itself would start to degrade as can happen if the user has a microscope where excessive light power is used. A good workflow we have started to implement is simply to perform imaging of the fluorescent sequencing adapter to check the library quality and image any additional fluorophores like fluorescent proteins or antibody staining. With several samples this usually takes an entire day so at the end of the day take the best samples that you intend to continue with and strip the fluorescent sequencing adapter with formamide and wash. After that leave the sample in 37°C overnight with the CIP + TdT/acyclovir cocktail. In the morning when you come in the sample is then ready for some quick washes and hybridization of the first sequencing primer followed by ligation. ",

    "title": "Difference between cPAL, SOLiD and PRICKLi.",
    "content": "The most basic scheme of sequencing by ligation was commercialized by Complete Genomics and is called Combinatorial Probe-Anchor Ligation (cPAL) sequencing. In cPAL a sequencing primer known as the anchor primer is extended by ligation of a set of competing probes interrogating a specific position away from the ligation junction. Each base position is represented by a specific fluorescent probe. This scheme is straighforward but requires 4 x N probes to be synthesized, where N is number of positions interrogated. Each ligation cycle extends a new sequencing primer so after each image is taken the entire sequencing primer is stripped and a new primer is hybridized. SOLiD (Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection) was a method commercialized by Applied Biosystems that overcame the issue by being able to extend the same sequencing primer sequentially through repeated ligation cycles. The way SOLiD overcame this was to make use of a chemically cleavable phosphoramidite probe that could be cleaved with a mild oxidizing agent such as aqueous silver nitrate leaving free 5’PO4 ends for subsequent ligation cycles to extend. In this scheme it is common to seperate the concept of a round to mean hybridization round and the concept of cycle to mean ligation cycle. SOLiD would achieve reads by extending and cleaving a single sequencing primer and then once the highest read length was achieved the entire extended primer complex would be stripped away and a new recessed sequencing primer would be hybridized and extended. Traditionally five hybridization rounds was performed with seven ligation cycles giving a read length of 5 x 7 = 35bp. PRICKLi is simply an enzymatic way to achieve similar SBL primer extension, cleave, re-ligate as SOLiD but with using cheap off-shelf oligonucleotide modifications. The added twist is the trick to piggy back on the improved confocal imaging and do multiple base calls by color multiplexing similar like Illumina NextSeq but instead of saving on laser cost the free fluorescent channels are used to encode directionality since SBL, unlike SBS, can sequence from both ends of the primer.
